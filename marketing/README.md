## 🚀 Growth Projects

1.  **Multi-Channel Attribution:** Use the acquisition dataset to determine which combination of ads (FB -> Google -> Email) most often leads to a purchase.
2.  **Next-Best-Action (NBA):** Predict which offer (10% off vs Free Shipping) a user is most likely to click using the email dataset.
3.  **Influencer ROI Shield:** Identify "fake" influencers whose engagement doesn't translate to conversion by comparing follower counts to results.

## 🎯 Strategies & Tips

- **Attribution:** Experiment with "Last Click" vs "Linear" vs "Data-Driven" attribution models.
- **Statistical Significance:** Always calculate the Confidence Interval for A/B test results.
- **Visuals:** Growth data looks best in **Cohort Heatmaps** and **Waterfall Funnels**.
